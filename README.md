# DIY Hot Air Coffee Roaster

This repository is my latest attempt to make home coffee roasting simple, reliable, scientific, and affordable.

## Features

- Control both temperature and fan level during roast with linear interpolation between user defined setpoints.
- PID for precise temperature control.
- Send roast data wirelessly to [Artisan](https://artisan-scope.org) to visualize and record roasts.
- Uses commercial-off-the-shelf components.
- Project includes 3D printed enclosure designs, custom PCB, and build instructions.

## Build

### Case

The case is modeled in [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ee717da6534241d41072245e/w/709854c2acbee5e38b890bec/e/be6e653fbb47fc1f3247d478?renderMode=0&uiState=65b72c2e65c4bf7511b63553).

Print the following components. PLA works well.

- Enclosure Botton
- Enclosure Top
- 3x PCB Standoff
- Handle
- Handle - Trim
- Power Supply Mount
- 4x Feet (TPU)

Order the following:

#### Finishing (optional)

To acheive a high-gloss kitchen appliance look, use automotive spot putty, high build primer, and fine sanding pads to prepare printed parts for paint. Then use a couple coats of spray paint and clear coat.

### Electronics

The roaster controller consists of a Nextion display paired with a simple interface board containing an Arduino Nano ESP32, fan speed controller, and pin headers.

## Firmware Installation

1. This project uses the Arduino IDE to intially program the Arduino Nano ESP32. Open `roaster-firmware/` directory in Arduino and upload to your Arduino Nano ESP32. The firmware supports over-the-air updates, so subsequent updates can be made by uploading a new `roaster-firmware.ino.bin` file to [http://roaster.local/update](http://roaster.local/update).
1. Copy the `Nextion/roaster1.tft` file to a microSD card and insert into the Nextion display before powering on to install the display firmware.

## Roaster modification

1. Disassemble popcorn popper by removing 4 screws at the bottom.
   ![popper disassembly step 1](./images/popper-mod-1.jpeg)
   ![popper disassembly step 1b](./images/popper-mod-1b.jpeg)
1. Remove popper core from base.
   ![popopper disassembly step 2](./images/popper-mod-2.jpeg)
1. Remove diodes and wiring from the fan motor, and remove the connectors from the heater wires.
   ![popper disassembly step 3](./images/popper-mod-3.jpeg)
1. Remove and reassemble the motor side of the popper core to remove the bimetalic strip used to operate the popper thermostat.
   ![popper disassembly step 4](./images/popper-mod-4.jpeg)
1. Remove popper power switch and replace with `Cube` printed part. This gives a place to mount the snubber circuit (to filter electrical noise generated by the motor) and makes reassembly easier.
1. Wire the motor through the snubber circuit with 22ga silicon wire.
1. Connect the heater wires as shown to 16ga silicon wire.
   ![popper disassembly step 5](./images/popper-mod-5.jpeg)
1. Reassemble the popper core to the popper base.
1. Drill a hole in the side of the roasting chamber and install the thermocouple. Remove the metal tube at the end of the thermocouple with a hacksaw, so the bare thermocouple is in contact with the hot air of the chamber.
   ![popper thermocouple install](./images/popper-mod-7.jpeg)
1. Mount the popper base to the `Enclosure Bottom` printed part with a couple of M4 nuts and bolts. Align the holes in the `Enclosure Bottom` with the popper base screw holes, and drill a hole in the popper base to match the mounting holes in the middle. Run the wires through the slot in the base.

## Assembly

1. Build wire assemblies.
   ![annotated wires](./images/Annotated%20wires.jpeg)
1. Use superglue to attach the 4x feet, the 3x PCB standoffs and power supply mount. For the power supply mount, make sure it's roughly in the middle and doesn't intefere with any holes.
   ![popper assembly step 1](./images/Roaster%20-%20Apart.jpeg)
1. Attach the display, Roaster Control PCB, and thermocouple module to the case with small screws.
1. Wire it up!

## Software Configuration

1. (Optional) Configure WiFi. Navigate to **Settings»WiFi** and enter your WiFi credentials.

## Artisan

Send roast data wirelessly to [Artisan](https://artisan-scope.org) to visualize and record roasts.

### Configure Artisan

1. Download and install [Artisan](https://artisan-scope.org)
2. Configure the Artisan to connect to the Roaster via WebSockets. Apply the `Artisan/astisan-settings.aset` file (**Help»Load Settings…**) or manually configure the settings as documented below.
   1. Configure Port settings (**Config»Port…**)
      ![Artisan Port configuration dialog](./images/Artisan%20-%20Port%20Config.png)
   2. Configure Device settings (**Config»Device…**)
      ![Artisan Device configuration dialog](./images/Artisan%20-%20Device%20Config.png)
      ![Artisan Device configuration dialog 2](./images/Artisan%20-%20Device%20Config2.png)

### Run

1. Press the **ON** button to enable the Roaster connection. You should `WebSocket connected` along with the current roaster and setpoint temperatures.
   ![Artisan start roast screen](./images/Artisan%20-%20Start%20roast%20screen.png)
2. Press **Start Roast** on the Roaster and the recording should automatically start within Artisan.
